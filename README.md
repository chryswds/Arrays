# Arrays

program that allows the user to interact with arrays in different ways

Firstly it asks the user for how many elements the array should have 

after the user's answer the program asks the user if they want to choose the numbers of the array or
if they should be randomly generated

after one of the options is chosen the program asks the user what they want to do with the array

  1 - method countFrequency - shows how many times the numbers appered in the array - only shows numbers that appear more than once
  2 - method totalArray - shows the sum of all numbers in the array
  3 - method sequenceArrayNum - shows numbers in an ascending order
  4 - method descendingSequence - shows numbers in a descending order
  5 - method calculateArrayAvg - shows the average of the numbers

code uses validation from class InputUtils to make sure user can only type what they were asked to
